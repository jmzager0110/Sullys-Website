    <h2>His Interests, Which You Should Care Most About</h2>
    <img class="interest" alt="Not only is he interested, he is properly standing guard upon his chair, which you can not sit in right now." src="indeximages/sullyintersts.jpg" />
    <ul>
      <li>He is a boy, and considered to be a "Custom Blend" of at least <s>Corgi and Yorkshire Terrier</s></li>
      <li>He goes by Sully, if you're nasty <sub>(by which he only means there is some aromatic fantasy scent about you)</sub>.</li>
      <li>An Undercover Snuggler, he prefers to snuggle under covers, as God intended.</li>
      <li>Speaking of God, a few friends are convinced his large ears helped him gracefully descend from the heavens, because he's a g-d angel.</li>
      <li>He prefers steak and raw fish for his meals, but will settle with <a href="http://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/dog-food/merrick-backcountry-grain-free-raw-infused-great-plains-red-meat-adult-dog-food" target="_blank">Merrick Back Country</a> or <a href="http://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/dog/hills-science-diet-oral-care-adult-dog-food" target="_blank">Hill's Science Diet Oral Care.</a></li>
      <li>Mainly, he is very gifted in the art of barking at things in the dark.</li>
      <li>But, as he is very aware, he is literally the most handsome man on Earth.</li>

    <h2> UPDATE, FEBRUARY 2017: Sullly's DNA Results Are IN! </h2>
    <img alt="Debbie Swan sent him a very special card she handmade while working at Hammerpress in Kansas City, Missouri." src="indeximages/sullychi.jpg"/>
    <p>After years of being considered a Corgi/Yorkie mix by his great finders at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Corgi-Connection-of-Kansas-275120539188626/" target="_blank"> The Corgi Connection of Kansas </a>, it turns out... HE IS HALF CHIHUAHUA! Also included is at least a quarter Toy Poodle.</p>
    <p> He was found in a Sutherland's lumberyard outside of Manhattan, Kansas in the frozen tundra of a central Kansas winter, shivering and scared. The angels of the Corgi Connection took him into their foster program as an honoree Corgi/Yorkie/Terrier Mix. This is how he found his way to the kingdom he reigns over now.</p>
    <p>Christmas of 2016, it was decided to finally confirm or deny his rich Corgi heritage using a DNA kit from the Wisdom Panel. The surprising news was shared on his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BQlcD_Wh99M/?taken-by=sullivan_tiberius&hl=en" target="_blank">Instagram page</a>, which even had a team member from the Wisdom Panel chime in, "If it helps, the Chihuahua does cluster with the terrier genetic group (genetic groups differ from your standard AKC breed groups), so you can still be a terrier mix!"</p>
